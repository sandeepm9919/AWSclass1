Here's a simplified system design diagram for an event-driven architecture that triggers an email survey as soon as a purchase transaction occurs at Walmart

* **Walmart Point of Sale (POS) System:** This is where the purchase transactions happen. Each purchase transaction generates an event containing relevant details such as transaction ID, items purchased, customer information, etc.
* **Event Producer:** A component within the POS system responsible for capturing transaction events and publishing them to a message broker. This could be implemented using technologies like Kafka, RabbitMQ, or AWS Kinesis.
* **Message Broker**: Acts as a central hub for receiving and distributing events. It stores the events temporarily and ensures reliable delivery to downstream services. Examples include Kafka, RabbitMQ, or AWS SQS.
* **Event Handler Service:** Subscribes to the transaction events from the message broker. It processes these events and determines if they are eligible for triggering an email survey. This service may include business logic to filter transactions, validate data, and decide when to send surveys.
* **Email Service:** Responsible for sending out email surveys to customers. It receives a trigger from the Event Handler Service when a qualifying transaction occurs. The email content can be personalized based on the transaction details.
* **Survey Response Collector:** This component manages the collection of survey responses from customers. It could be a simple REST API endpoint or a database that stores responses for analysis.

Here's how the flow would work:
* When a purchase transaction occurs at Walmart, the POS system generates an event and sends it to the Event Producer.
* The Event Producer publishes the transaction event to the Message Broker.
* The Event Handler Service subscribes to the events from the Message Broker and processes them.
* If a transaction meets the criteria for triggering a survey (e.g., high-value purchase, first-time customer), the Event Handler Service sends a trigger to the Email Service.
* The Email Service composes and sends an email survey to the customer.
* The Survey Response Collector handles the incoming survey responses and stores them for analysis.

**This architecture allows for scalability, as components can be scaled independently based on workload and performance requirements. Additionally, it ensures loose coupling between different parts of the system, making it easier to maintain and evolve over time.**
