<ins>**DATA MESH PRINCIPLES AND ARCHITECTURE:**

**I WILL EXPLAIN STEP BY STEP PROCESS WITH DIAGRAMS**

<ins>**STEP1:**

**Demystifying Data Mesh: A Distributed Architecture for the Modern Enterprise**
* In today's data-driven world, organizations are struggling to manage and unlock the value of their ever-growing data. Traditional centralized data architectures are becoming cumbersome and slow to adapt. Data mesh offers a promising alternative, promoting a distributed and self-serve approach to data management. This presentation will explore the core principles of data mesh and how it can empower your organization to achieve greater agility and data-driven success.

<ins>**STEP2:**

**The Challenges of Traditional Data Architectures**

* Data Silos: Information is fragmented across different departments and systems, hindering collaboration and insights.
* Slow Delivery: Centralized teams become bottlenecks, delaying access to critical data for business users.
* Limited Ownership: Lack of accountability for data quality and accuracy leads to inconsistencies and errors.
* Scalability Issues: Centralized infrastructure struggles to keep pace with growing data volumes and user demands.
  
**Notes:**
Centralized data lakes and warehouses, while offering a single source of truth, often face significant challenges. Data silos and ownership issues prevent users from accessing and utilizing the data effectively. Slow delivery cycles hamper innovation and responsiveness to changing business needs. Additionally, centralized systems become expensive and complex to scale as data volumes increase.
